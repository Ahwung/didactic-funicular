## Technology Used

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Approach

Looking at my own life, I've noticed that I lose track of the restaurants that I've been to and really like, so I wanted to create a database where anyone can add their restaurants in order to get a comprehensive list. I also wanted to create a page for each user so that they could favorite their own places and have their own personal page where they can see their favorites.

## Current functionality

Each page for the website has the navbar where the user can navigate to any page they wish. When creating a restaurant, the new one will show up on the index page where all the restaurants are listed. Currently, users cannot edit or delete any restaurant unless the user has signed up for an account and logged in. When clicking on the favorites page, the user will be redirected to the log in page.

## Needs work

There are still a few bugs in the website that I need to work on. When on the Add Restaurant page, when navigating to the favorites page, it throws an error at the moment, so I need to have a better redirect there. When adding favorites to the personal page, the page doesn't reload the page with the new favorites, you can only see if you log out and log back in. 

## Future features

I'm planning on making certain users have moderator clearance so that only they can edit restaurants and also delete restaurants. I also plan to put links to Google maps on each show page so that the user can easily find where the resaurant is and also a link to the actual yelp page so that the user can get even more details.
